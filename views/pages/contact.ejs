					Leslie Quijano's first intimate encounter with a pet was when her dog Buzz saved her life from a devastating flood during Hurricane Harvey. His love for Leslie prevailed as he bravely pulled her to safety from rushing waters in the streets. She is now the co founder of Meet Mutts and has an absolute passion to matching owners with the perfect pet.
